OOPS :- Object Oriented Programming System        //JAVA is based on OOPS

-->Varargs- Variable arguments  (...a(to indicating it's a array or string type can accept many no. of arguments))


Abstraction:

1.Abstract metods are the methods can only be declared without defining
  --> public abstract void login();

2.Abstract class can have abstract methods as well as non-abstract.

3.A non-abstract class can't have a abstract Method.

4.we cannot create objects of abstract Methods.

5.if we extend a abstract class and the new class is not abstract type then 
  no declared methods of abstract class must overridden by the new class methods. 
  and the new class is known as concrete class.


Interface:-

1.Declare a method.
2.Cannot define a method.
3.Cannot create object.
4.Two interfaces can be extends by a class at a same time.
5.Every method in interface is public and abstract by default.
6.Class-Class->extends , interface-class->implements ,
  interface-interface->extends
7.In New version of java we can define methods in interface 
  by using keyboard default and also by static.
--> Marker interface: Interface with no declaration,these are used to give permissions to some methods.


-->int i,float f,double d,....these are premittive variables not object.
-->Wrapping:-
  int i;
  Integer iobj=new Integer(i);                   //boxing                          //Wrapper Classes in java
  Integer jj=i;                 //autoboxing
-->Unwrapping:-                                //Taking out the value from object
  int j=iobj.intvalue();        //Unboxing


-->Strings are immutable once we create it we dont replace it we create another when we change it.
